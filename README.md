This is a custom catalogue created using React JS and Google Firestore to index Geospatial Educational Resources. The project was funded by a 2018 ISPRS Scientific Initiatives grant (https://www.isprs.org/society/si/default.aspx) awarded to the ISPRS WG IV/9, ISPRS WG IV/6, ICA Commission on SDIs and Standards, and the Mongolian Geospatial Association. 

The pilot catalogue is available at https://isprs.education/
